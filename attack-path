# Attack Path â€“ Rekall Penetration Test

## Initial Objectives

- Breach web application and internal systems
- Gain administrator privileges
- Capture and exfiltrate sensitive data

---

## 1. Reconnaissance

Tools: whois, nmap, nikto, manual browsing

- Discovered public-facing login portal
- Exposed metadata via SSL certs, robots.txt, headers

---

## 2. Vulnerability Identification

### Web App Issues:

| Vulnerability        | Description                                 | Severity |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------|----------|
| Reflected XSS        | Input reflected unsanitized to DOM          | High     |
| SQL Injection        | Login bypass using `ok' OR 1=1--`           | Critical |
| Local File Inclusion | Uploading `.jpg.php` file led to LFI        | High     |
| Command Injection    | Unsanitized inputs passed to shell (DNS/MX) | High     |
| Sensitive Data Leak  | robots.txt, HTML source, HTTP headers       | Medium   |

### Host Exploits:

- RCE via Shellshock on CGI endpoint
- Tomcat WAR deployment on .10 host
- Unpatched Nessus vulnerabilities on .12

---

## 3. Gaining Foothold

- Logged into target Linux host via SSH using dumped creds
- Deployed Metasploit payload for reverse shell access
- Uploaded tools (enum4linux, winPEAS, BloodHound)

---

## 4. Privilege Escalation

- On Windows, used winPEAS to identify unquoted service path
- Dumped LSASS via Mimikatz and captured domain admin credentials
- Used PsExec to gain Domain Admin shell

---

## 5. Post-Exploitation

- Captured 10+ flags from multiple systems
- Exfiltrated HR files and system credentials
- Cleaned up payloads and verified persistence removal

---

## Outcome

- Complete domain compromise
- Detailed remediation steps provided in report
